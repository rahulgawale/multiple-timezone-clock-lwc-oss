# lwc-multi-zone-clock

Hello There! I have created a simple Lightning Web Component Open Source App to display a mutltiple timezone clocks. Here is the live version of my app : https://rahulgawale.github.io/multiple-timezone-clock-lwc-oss/

## How to start?

Start simple by running `yarn watch` (or `npm run watch`, if you set up the project with `npm`). This will start the project with a local development server.

The source files are located in the [`src`](./src) folder. All web components are within the [`src/modules`](./src/modules) folder. The folder hierarchy also represents the naming structure of the web components.
